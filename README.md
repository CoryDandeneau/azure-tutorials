## Windows Azure, Ruby on Rails, Capistrano 3 & PostgreSQL

This tutorial will show you how to create and deploy a basic Ruby on Rails app onto your own [Windows Azure](http://windowsazure.com) Linux Virtual Machine using [Capistrano 3](http://capistranorb.com) to manage the deployment tasks including database migrations and versioning. Be sure to follow closely and don't skip any steps, missing just one can result in lots of frustration (trust me, I know!).
